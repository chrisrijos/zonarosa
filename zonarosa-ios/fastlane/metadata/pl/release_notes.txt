• Now you can optionally add a member label to describe yourself or your role in a group chat. Set your group member label to “Referee” or “Goalie” in your local rec league soccer chat to help kick things off when new teammates join, then choose a different label with your job title in the company chat. Member labels appear next to your profile name in that group, and group admins can control who can set a label with the “Edit Group Info” permission.
